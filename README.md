# FRPG-Automation
Just a tiny little innocent python script that automates certain things in a certain browser game.
>**WARNING:** this was made for the pure joy of researching and learning. Farm RPG's Code of Conduct disallows bots 
from being used as they throttle the servers, that is why I have made it so this bot actually has humane reaction
times and doesn't give the player an unfair advantage. Still, it should not be used.

## Features
Although it requires some manual tweaking, here's what it can do currently:

- Auto farming
- Auto sacrifice
- Auto seed buying
- Auto fishing
- Auto exploring
